This project implements a book recommendation engine based on a Goodreads dataset available from this [url](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k).

The project consists of two parts:
1. A set of Python scripts that generate, impute and apply SVD on the ratings utility matrix, rsulting in a predictions matrix.
2. A Flask-bsed web application using these matrices along with the Goodreads API to produce book recommendations.

## Dependencies

* pandas
* pandas
* matplotlib
* pickle
* scipy.sparse
* [sparsesvd](https://pypi.org/project/sparsesvd/)
* xml.etree.ElementTree
* flask

## Installation

Download the dataset and run the Python scripts from the same directory.

Before running the web application, copy the following files to the /webapp directory:
* books.csv
* user_ratings_matrix.dat (generated by create_utility_matrix.py)
* predictions_matrix.dat (generated by svd.py)

Note that use of the Goodreads API requries an API key and a secret, which can be requested here: [https://www.goodreads.com/api](https://www.goodreads.com/api).
